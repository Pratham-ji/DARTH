# Self-Hosted WireGuard VPN

## Introduction

In an era where online privacy and security are paramount, setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN) is essential for safeguarding sensitive information. This project focuses on creating a self-hosted WireGuard VPN, which allows users to encrypt their internet traffic and maintain privacy while browsing. Unlike commercial VPN services, this solution empowers users to control their own VPN server, ensuring enhanced privacy, security, and cost-effectiveness.

This repository contains the backend setup for the WireGuard VPN, demonstrating how to configure the server and manage keys. While the project is not fully complete, it serves as a foundational step towards building a robust VPN solution.

## Features

- **WireGuard Protocol:** Utilizes the modern and efficient WireGuard protocol for secure connections.
- **Key Management:** Implements public-private key pairs for authentication.
- **Configuration Flexibility:** Allows customization of network settings and peer configurations.
- **Edge Case Considerations:** Addresses potential issues and scenarios that may arise during setup and operation.

## Edge Cases Considered

1. **Network Interruptions:**
   - Handling unexpected disconnections and reconnections.
   - Implementing automatic reconnection strategies.

2. **Invalid Authentication Attempts:**
   - Logging failed connection attempts.
   - Implementing rate limiting to prevent brute-force attacks.

3. **User  Access Control:**
   - Managing user permissions and access to the VPN.
   - Key rotation and revocation processes.

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Monitoring VPN performance under different loads.
   - Adjusting encryption settings for optimal speed and security.

5. **Dynamic IP Handling:**
   - Using Dynamic DNS for peers with changing IP addresses.
   - Ensuring seamless connectivity for remote users.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set up your WireGuard VPN on macOS:

### Prerequisites

- macOS (preferably the latest version)
- Homebrew installed on your system

### Step 1: Install WireGuard

Open your Terminal and run the following command to install WireGuard:

```bash
brew install wireguard-tools
```

### Step 2: Create Configuration Directory

Create a directory for your WireGuard configuration:

```bash
mkdir ~/wireguard-vpn
cd ~/wireguard-vpn
```

### Step 3: Generate Key Pair

Generate your private and public keys:

```bash
wg genkey | tee privatekey | wg pubkey > publickey
```

### Step 4: Create WireGuard Configuration File

Open a text editor to create your configuration file:

```bash
nano wg0.conf
```

Add the following configuration, replacing the placeholders with your actual keys and desired settings:

```ini
[Interface]
PrivateKey = <Your_Private_Key>
Address = 10.0.0.1/24
ListenPort = 51820

[Peer]
PublicKey = <Peer_Public_Key>
AllowedIPs = 10.0.0.2/32
Endpoint = <Peer_Public_IP>:51820
```

### Step 5: Start WireGuard VPN

Bring up the VPN interface:

```bash
sudo wg-quick up ~/wireguard-vpn/wg0.conf
```

### Step 6: Check Status

Verify that the VPN is running:

```bash
sudo wg
```

### Step 7: Stop WireGuard VPN

When you are done, you can stop the VPN:

```bash
sudo wg-quick down ~/wireguard-vpn/wg0.conf
```

## Conclusion

This project serves as a foundational backend setup for a self-hosted WireGuard VPN. While it is not fully complete, it provides a solid starting point for further development and enhancement. Future work will focus on improving security measures, user management, and performance optimization.
